                    If you take a look at the SDK's src directory, among the list of packages, 'context' stands out as the most
                    ambiguous name. The 'context' package <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14660">migrated to Go 1.7</a>
                    from <a href="http://golang.org/x/net/context">golang.org/x/net/context</a> (note the path: 'net' is
                    not accidental; this package was used for canceling HTTP requests). Brad Fitzpatrick, a Go developer from 2010
                    to 2020, suggested <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14660">in his proposal</a>
                    the potential use of context not only for canceling HTTP requests but also
                    for stopping TCP dialers (establishing TCP connections), halting OS child processes launched through os/exec,
                    canceling SQL queries, and more. When you encounter a function or method that takes a context.Context, you
                    should perceive it as an opportunity to control the cancellation of its execution.
                </p>

                <h2>Cancellation Without Context</h2>
                <p>
                    How can you achieve the task of cancellation without the context package? One of the most obvious ways to
                    implement cancellation is by using a 'done' channel as the first argument to the function. Excellent examples
                    can also be found in the article <a href="https://go.dev/blog/pipelines">https://go.dev/blog/pipelines</a>
                </p>

                <h2>The Context Package</h2>
                <p>
                    To address the task of procedure cancellation in Go, the SDK provides the 'context' package. The 'context'
                    package is a micro-framework designed for communicating with procedures, often through signals to cancel their
                    execution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I couldn't find references to the specific choice of this name for the packages. By examining <a
                        href="https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Context-Object-Pattern.pdf">the first publication</a> about
                    the Context Object pattern (Context Object, A Design Pattern for Efficient Information Sharing across Multiple
                    System Layers, 2005), the reasons for such a package name become clear. Quote from the publication:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    This pattern provides an efficient, and application
                    transparent way of sharing information between different layers in a software system.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The 'context' package in Go also serves for passing information between layers of an application, but in Go, the
                    emphasis is more on information related to the cancellation of procedure execution. The task of communication with a
                    procedure can also be solved by using a different approach, through a manager (Peter Sommerlad, "The Manager Design
                    Pattern," Pattern Languages of Program Design 3, Addison-Wesley, 1998.), but this solution has a significant
                    drawback: concurrent work with the manager requires synchronization between goroutines, for example, through
                    Mutexes.
                </p>

                <h2>How Context Works</h2>
                <p>
                    A bit about how context works in Go. The 'context' package provides the 'Context' interface, along with several
                    implementations, which can be composed into a chain. This is convenient if you have multiple reasons to cancel a
                    function (cancel call, timeout, deadline), and the cancellation should occur when any of them happen. Any
                    user-defined context is a child of another context, which is called the parent. Only the empty context
                    (context.Background() or context.TODO()) has no parent. This hierarchy is important because it determines which
                    of the context chain will be canceled when the parent is canceled.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ostretsov/8bce80d75c5123edb04bd9c5be0912b8.js"></script>

                <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    It is essential to understand that the context itself does not cancel the execution of a function. It merely
                    provides a mechanism for cancellation that needs to be implemented independently. Therefore, it is crucial to
                    inspect the source code of external packages and check how context is actually used.
                </p>

                <h2>Resource Management</h2>
                <p>
                    But what will happen if the context cancellation function is not called?
                    In the case of timerCtx, a timer is started, and when the time expires, a goroutine is launched, which then
                    calls the cancel function. Only after that, garbage collection occurs (i.e., resource cleanup). In the case of
                    cancelCtx, calling the cancel function clears the map of child contexts. If you are using custom contexts, you
                    may encounter goroutine leaks because only custom contexts initiate a goroutine waiting for the cancellation of
                    a parent or child context.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ostretsov/20935b56ab85593ec1ae59a1aa407470.js"></script>

                <h2>Context Values</h2>
                <p>
                    If you plan to use the context solely for passing data, it is better to create a specialized structure for this
                    purpose. Otherwise, you lose all the benefits of static typing since values in the context are stored as 'any'
                    type. The following recommendation may be useful: use context solely for cancellation and store values in the
                    context only when it is justified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How are values stored in cancelCtx? Each subsequent context holds a reference to the previous context. The
                    cancel context (context.cancelCtx) used under the hood as a context for cancellation by deadline/timeout
                    (timerCtx) holds references to all child contexts to be able to cancel them when the parent context is canceled.
                </p>

                <h2>HTTP Server Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's consider the usage of context in an HTTP server from the net/http package. The context here serves for
                    passing the HTTP server itself and the TCP address on which it is running. You can also enrich the context with
                    additional data using your own middlewares. Since the base context of the server (Server.BaseContext) passed to
                    each request can be overridden (default is context.Background()), you can use the context, for example, to
                    signal an imminent server restart (see a ready-made implementation in the SDK signal.NotifyContext).
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ostretsov/73e3c782acbb83407ccc14db4592f8b9.js"></script>
                </div>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://go.dev/play/p/5l6yBh3gcP1" class="playground-link">Run in Go Playground</a>

                <p>
                    In addition to middlewares, you can augment the context with data related to newly established TCP connections
                    through the ConnContext function of the server.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ostretsov/8eff34243e8cfef01271894b52f2b40b.js"></script>

                <p>
                    Some packages provide ready-made solutions for timeout cancellation. For example, you can use
                    http.TimeoutHandler if you need to limit the response time of a handler. The handler itself will continue its
                    execution until the program finishes if it does not explicitly check whether the request context is canceled.

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure that you cannot solve the task without using goroutines. If you can do without goroutines, you can do
                            without the context package.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you do not plan to cancel a procedure, pass an empty context (context.Background() or context.TODO()).
                        </li>
                        <li>If an external function takes a context.Context, check how it is used by inspecting its source code. The
                            context package provides mechanisms for cancellation, but not the cancellation of the procedure itself.
