        <h4>Review of "Engineer's Survival Guide": How to Survive as a Programmer in a Big Corporation</h4>
        <h5>26.05.2024. Boris Ostretsov</h5>
        <p>
            I just finished reading "Engineer's Survival Guide," and I wanted to share some cool tips from
            the book. If you're a programmer navigating the corporate jungle, this one's for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Know Your Project's Priority</strong>.
            First off, it's crucial to understand the importance of the project you're working on. If your project is
            low-priority, you're at a higher risk of being let go during cutbacks. Plus, getting extra resources to meet
            deadlines can be tougher. So, how do you figure this out? Talk to your manager. No one will outright tell
            you your project is unimportant, but by asking open-ended questions, you can gauge its significance to the
            company.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Visibility Matters</strong>.
            Everyone wants a promotion, right? But how does management decide who gets the nod? Visibility is key. If
            you're active in forums, doing code reviews, and participating in meetings, your name will be top of mind
            when promotion time comes around. So, make sure you're seen and heard!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Make Design Discussions Productive</strong>
            Design meetings often turn into debates where the focus shifts from technical solutions to winning the
            argument. This wastes a lot of time. To keep these calls effective, build allies. Seek advice on design
            decisions from respected colleagues. This way, the design becomes a team effort rather than a personal one,
            reducing the incentive to argue during meetings.
