        <h1>Code Optimization with PGO: How It Works and Why It's Needed</h1>
        <h5>June 9, 2024; Boris Ostretsov</h5>
        <p>
            Software optimization is a crucial aspect of development, especially when it comes to performance. One
            method of such optimization is Profile Guided Optimization (PGO). Let's understand what it is and how it
            works.
        </p>

        <h4>What is PGO?</h4>

        <p>
            PGO is a process where your server runs in a special mode in the production environment to gather execution
            statistics. Then, the server is recompiled using this data, allowing the compiler to create a more efficient
            executable file.
        </p>

        <p>
            The resulting executable consists of instructions in machine language, known as assembly. The essence of PGO
            is to optimize these instructions. Today, I'll talk about two approaches: inlining and branching.
        </p>

        <h4>The Go Compiler and Its Features</h4>

        <p>
            The Go compiler is known for its compilation speed. Unlike other languages, where the compilation process
            can take a long time, Go does it very quickly due to its simplicity. The creators of Go prioritized fast
            compilation and small binary size.
        </p>

        <h4>Inlining</h4>

        <p>
            When there is a function in the source code, the compiler creates a subroutine in assembly language. Calling
            a subroutine requires additional instructions, such as creating variables for parameters and jumping to the
            right place in the code. This creates some overhead.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inlining is the process of embedding the function's code directly into the place where it is called,
            reducing the number of instructions and speeding up execution. But why not inline all functions then?
            Because it increases the binary file size, and a small size was a priority for the Go creators. Therefore,
            only the most frequently used functions are inlined.
        </p>

        <h4>Branching</h4>

        <p>
            To understand branching, you need to know about CPU pipelining. Imagine you have the task of making borscht.
            This process consists of different stages: preparing vegetables, heating water, cooking. To speed up, you
            can perform some stages in parallel, for example, start heating water first and then peel the vegetables.
        </p>

        <p>
            In CPUs, pipelining works similarly. Instructions are executed in several stages: fetching, decoding,
            executing, and writing back to memory. All these stages can be performed in parallel. But if there is
            branching in the code, the pipeline can "stall," not knowing which branch to execute next.
        </p>

        <p>
            Collecting statistics allows predicting which branch will be executed more often and start executing it in
            advance. If the prediction is wrong, the processor discards the operations performed and starts executing
            the correct branch. The more accurate the predictions, the faster the program runs.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p>
            PGO helps optimize code, making programs faster and more efficient. Inlining reduces the number of
            instructions, and branching allows efficient use of CPU pipelining. Both approaches help achieve higher
            performance, which is especially important for server applications.
