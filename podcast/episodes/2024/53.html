    <h4>Review of "Engineer's Survival Guide": How to Survive as a Programmer in a Big Corporation</h4>

    <p>
        Hey everyone! I just finished reading "Engineer's Survival Guide," and I wanted to share some cool tips from the
        book. If you're a programmer navigating the corporate jungle, this one's for you.
        Know Your Project's Priority
    </p>

    <p>
        First off, it's crucial to understand the importance of the project you're working on. If your project is
        low-priority, you're at a higher risk of being let go during cutbacks. Plus, getting extra resources to meet
        deadlines can be tougher. So, how do you figure this out? Talk to your manager. No one will outright tell you
        your project is unimportant, but by asking open-ended questions, you can gauge its significance to the company.
        Visibility Matters
    </p>

    <p>
        Everyone wants a promotion, right? But how does management decide who gets the nod? Visibility is key. If you're
        active in forums, doing code reviews, and participating in meetings, your name will be top of mind when
        promotion time comes around. So, make sure you're seen and heard!
        Make Design Discussions Productive
    </p>

    <p>
        Design meetings often turn into debates where the focus shifts from technical solutions to winning the argument.
        This wastes a lot of time. To keep these calls effective, build allies. Seek advice on design decisions from
        respected colleagues. This way, the design becomes a team effort rather than a personal one, reducing the
        incentive to argue during meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's it for now! If you're working in a big corporation, these tips can help you navigate and thrive. Happy
        coding!
