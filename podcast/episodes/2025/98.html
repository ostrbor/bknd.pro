        Recently, I finished reading the book Master Software Architecture and wanted to share some quick takeaways.
        I’ll also explain the difference between architecture and design, talk a bit about e2e tests, and how all of
        this applies in a real startup.
    </p>

    <h4>Architecture vs Design</h4>

    <p>
        Architecture is a macro view of the application – the big picture, how different parts connect.
        Design is a micro view – the details inside each part.
    </p>

    <h4>Interesting Ideas From the Book</h4>

    <p>
        There were a few points that stood out:
    </p>

    <p>
        The 4 Drivers – These are the things that influence decisions when building software, like business goals, user
        needs, technical limits, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Deployment Strategies – Different ways to release software:
        all at once, blue-green (switch between two environments), rolling (update bit by bit), canary (release to a
        small group first).
    </p>

    <p>
        Testing Pyramid – A reminder that end-to-end (e2e) tests are fragile, they cover a lot, but they are also slow.
        So it's better not to rely too much on them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Applying It All to a Startup – Startups go through several phases:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Early days: everything is simple.</li>
        <li>As you add more features: the code gets messy, harder to maintain. You need to organize the project and the
            team better.
        </li>
        <li>When users grow: performance problems appear. One solution is to split modules into services and replicate
            them.
        </li>
        <li>Each decision adds complexity – that's normal. Every fix makes the system a bit harder to manage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Project Paradox</h4>
    <p>At the start, projects are simple and clean. But as features and users grow, things naturally get more
        complicated. Managing this complexity is what good software architecture is all about.</p>
